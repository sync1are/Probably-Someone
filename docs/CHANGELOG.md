# 📝 ARIA Changelog

## 2026-04-07 - Gmail Integration & Architecture Updates

### ✅ Completed Today
- **Gmail Integration** - Added secure, local OAuth 2.0 access to read important unread emails.
- **Smart Filtering** - Leveraged Google's built-in AI filter (`is:unread is:important`) to skip newsletters and spam.
- **Directory restructure** - Organized entire codebase into logical folders (`src/`, `messaging/`, `docs/`, `tests/`).
- **Clean Root** - Moved all scattered test reports and messaging apps out of the main directory.

### 📰 News & Information Added
- **Live News Feeds:** Added the `get_latest_news` tool to fetch real-time headlines using Google News RSS feeds. No API keys required. You can ask for general news or specific topics like "What's the news on Tesla?"

### 💻 File Operations Added
- **Read/Write Files:** Added capability for ARIA to save, read, and append to `.txt` files on your hard drive.
- **JSON Formatting:** Added specific support for creating well-formatted `.json` files.
- **Safety First:** All files are automatically saved into a dedicated `Documents/ARIA_Files` folder to prevent accidental overwrites of system files.

### 🖥️ Foundation Features (Phase 1 Complete)
- **Window Management:** Added commands to minimize, maximize, close, and switch specific windows.
- **App Launcher:** Can now launch apps (Chrome, VS Code, Discord) or open common websites by name.
- **System Audio Control:** Mute/unmute, set master volume percentage.
- **Smart Media Routing:** Added intelligent conflict resolution. E.g., saying "Next track" checks if Spotify is playing first; if not, it falls back to system media keys (controlling YouTube, VLC, etc.).

### 📧 Gmail Features Added
- Added `gmail_tools.py` with secure local auth flow
- Requested Read-Only scopes for maximum privacy/security
- Implemented HTML-to-Text decoding for reading email bodies aloud
- Added `get_important_unread_emails` and `read_specific_email` to `tools.json`
